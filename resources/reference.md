## Chapter-by-Chapter Reference

---

### Chapter 1 — Analytics Engineering
**Pages:** 1–22

**Key Insights:**
- History of data management: data warehouses (Inmon/Kimball 1980s–90s) → Big Data/Hadoop → cloud (Redshift, BigQuery, Snowflake) → modern data stack (Airflow, dbt, Looker)
- The analytics engineer role sits at the intersection of data engineering and data analytics — owns the transformation layer
- **ELT vs. ETL:** ELT (load first, transform in place) is the modern pattern; dbt owns the T in ELT
- Data mesh: dbt as an enabler for distributed, domain-owned data products
- Legacy processes (stored procedures, ETL tools) versus the dbt revolution: version control, testing, docs, CI/CD parity with software engineering
- dbt is open source CLI (dbt Core) or managed service (dbt Cloud); both run the same commands

**Code Exercise:**
- **Example 1-3 (p. 21):** Minimal dbt model — a `SELECT` with `{{ ref() }}` and `{{ config(materialized='table') }}` that sums revenue across orders. Demonstrates that every dbt model is just a `SELECT` statement.

**Training Module:** Pre-reading for **Module 1**. Covers the "why" of dbt at industry level and reinforces Bloomwell's exact motivation for adopting dbt.

---

### Chapter 2 — Data Modeling for Analytics
**Pages:** 23–66

**Key Insights:**
- Data modeling has three phases: **conceptual** (entities + relationships), **logical** (tables, FKs, normalization), **physical** (SQL DDL for a specific DB engine)
- **Normalization forms** (1NF–5NF): reduce redundancy, enforce integrity; higher normal forms split data into more tables
- **Dimensional modeling (Kimball):** fact tables (measurable events) + dimension tables (context) → star schema; snowflake schema extends this by normalizing dimensions further
- **Star schema** vs. **snowflake schema**: star is simpler and faster to query; snowflake is more normalized and storage-efficient
- **Data Vault:** hub-satellite-link design, optimized for environments where source systems change frequently
- **Modular data models in dbt:** staging layer (clean/rename) → intermediate layer (business logic) → marts layer (facts + dims); mirrors Bloomwell's Bronze→Staging→Silver→Gold
- **Medallion Architecture (pp. 63–66):** Bronze (raw, append-only) → Silver (clean, tested, conformed dims + facts) → Gold (aggregated, BI-ready); dbt owns Silver and Gold

**Code Exercise:**
- No executable code exercises in this chapter. The modeling concepts are illustrated with entity-relationship diagrams and schema designs.
- Suggested activity: sketch the star schema for Bloomwell's HubSpot data (deals, contacts, pipeline stages) using the conceptual → logical → physical workflow described on pp. 25–31.

**Training Module:**
- **Module 1** pre-reading: pp. 47–66 (Modular Data Models + Medallion Architecture) — gives the theoretical foundation for Bloomwell's layer architecture
- **Module 5** pre-reading: pp. 63–66 (Medallion Architecture Pattern section) — directly explains Bronze/Silver/Gold semantics

---

### Chapter 3 — SQL for Analytics
**Pages:** 67–133

**Key Insights:**
- SQL has outlasted every generation of tooling (OLTP → Hadoop → cloud DW) because of readability, strong typing, and ecosystem ubiquity
- **DDL** (Data Definition Language): `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP` — defines structure
- **DML** (Data Manipulation Language): `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` — operates on data
- **Views:** store a query definition, not data; computed on every access; ideal for abstraction and security (mirrors dbt `view` materialization)
- **CTEs** (`WITH` clause): break complex queries into named intermediate steps; dbt ephemeral models compile to CTEs in downstream models
- **Window functions** (`RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER`, `LAG`, `LEAD`, `SUM OVER`): perform calculations across a partition without collapsing rows — essential for SCD2 and ranking analytics
- **SQL for distributed processing:** DuckDB (fast in-process analytics, no dependencies), Polars, FugueSQL — modern SQL engines beyond traditional warehouses

**Code Exercises:**

| Example | Pages | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 3-1 to 3-4 | pp. 80–82 | Create `OReillyBooks` database; `CREATE TABLE` for authors, books, categories with PKs and FKs; `ALTER TABLE` to add a column |
| 3-5 to 3-7 | pp. 83–85 | `INSERT INTO` dummy data for all four tables; `SELECT *` to verify |
| 3-8 to 3-11 | pp. 85–87 | `SELECT` with `WHERE`, comparison/logical operators, `LIKE`, `IN`, `BETWEEN` |
| (section) | pp. 87–95 | `GROUP BY` + aggregate functions (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`); `HAVING` clause |
| (section) | pp. 96–105 | `JOIN` types (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS); multi-table queries |
| (section) | pp. 98–101 | `CREATE VIEW` and querying views |
| (section) | pp. 101–104 | CTEs with `WITH` — chaining intermediate result sets |
| (section) | pp. 105–109 | Window functions: `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `LAG()`, `SUM() OVER (PARTITION BY ...)` |
| (section) | pp. 113–116 | DuckDB: in-memory analytics queries, CSV and Parquet reads |
| (bonus) | pp. 129–133 | Training ML models with SQL (Dask-SQL) |

**Training Module:**
- **Module 3 (Jinja)** supplement: pp. 98–104 (Views + CTEs) — understand what dbt `view` and `ephemeral` materialize to
- **Module 6 (Testing)** supplement: the `GROUP BY` + `HAVING` pattern (pp. 87–90) is exactly how singular dbt tests are written
- **Module 10 (SCD2)** pre-reading: pp. 105–109 (Window Functions) — `ROW_NUMBER()` and `LAG()` are the SQL primitives behind SCD2 logic
- **Module 12 (CI/CD)** supplement: pp. 113–116 (DuckDB) — relevant for unit testing SQL logic locally

---

### Chapter 4 — Data Transformation with dbt
**Pages:** 135–221

**Key Insights:**
- **dbt design philosophy** (pp. 136–137): code-centric, modular, declarative, SQL-only, documentation-as-code, incremental builds, native integration with data platforms
- **dbt data flow:** source systems → raw/bronze → dbt staging → dbt intermediate → dbt marts; dbt owns only the transformation steps
- **dbt Cloud vs. dbt Core:** Cloud is managed (scheduling, IDE, CI); Core is open source CLI — Bloomwell uses Core
- **Project structure** (pp. 165–167): `models/`, `macros/`, `seeds/`, `snapshots/`, `tests/`, `analyses/`, `target/`, `dbt_project.yml`
- **YAML file organization** (pp. 168–174): one `_sources.yml` + one `_models.yml` per models directory; use `_` prefix so files sort to the top
- **`dbt_project.yml`** (pp. 170–173): sets project name, model paths, default materializations per directory; all models inherit unless overridden
- **`profiles.yml`** (pp. 172–173): lives outside repo (`~/.dbt/`); contains environment-specific DB credentials
- **Models as SELECT statements** (pp. 174–184): staging layer (rename/cast), intermediate layer (joins, business logic), marts layer (facts + dims)
- **`{{ source() }}`** (pp. 184–188): registers Bronze/raw tables; enables freshness checks, lineage tracking; required before any `source()` call in a model
- **Generic tests** (pp. 189–196): `unique`, `not_null`, `accepted_values`, `relationships` — declared in YAML alongside columns
- **Singular tests** (pp. 189–196): standalone `.sql` files in `tests/`; return rows on failure
- **Documentation** (pp. 200–208): model descriptions + column descriptions in YAML; `{{ doc('...') }}` for reusable doc blocks in `.md` files; `dbt docs generate` → `dbt docs serve`
- **dbt commands** (pp. 209–211): `dbt run`, `dbt test`, `dbt build`, `dbt compile`, `dbt debug`, `dbt source freshness`, `dbt docs generate`
- **Selection syntax** (pp. 209–211): `--select model_name`, `--select +model_name+`, `--select tag:staging`, `--select source:jaffle_shop`

**Code Exercises:**

| Example | Pages | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 4-1 | p. 142 | Query Jaffle Shop public BigQuery dataset (customers, orders, payments) |
| 4-3 | p. 165 | Initial dbt project folder structure after `dbt init` |
| 4-4 | p. 169 | Recommended YAML file layout per models directory |
| 4-5 | p. 170 | `dbt_project.yml` model config: staging → view |
| 4-6 | p. 172 | `packages.yml` — install from dbt Hub, Git, or local |
| 4-7 | p. 173 | `profiles.yml` for BigQuery with service account |
| 4-8 to 4-11 | pp. 175–178 | Write three staging models (`stg_stripe_order_payments`, `stg_jaffle_shop_customers`, `stg_jaffle_shop_orders`); run `dbt run --full-refresh` |
| (section) | pp. 184–188 | Declare sources in `_jaffle_shop_sources.yml`; reference with `{{ source() }}` |
| (section) | pp. 189–196 | Write generic tests (`unique`, `not_null`, `relationships`) in `_jaffle_shop_models.yml`; run `dbt test` |
| (section) | pp. 200–208 | Add model and column descriptions; run `dbt docs generate && dbt docs serve` |

**Training Modules:**
- **Module 2** (Project Setup): pp. 135–173 — `dbt_project.yml`, `profiles.yml`, project structure, the five execution phases, CLI commands
- **Module 3** (Jinja): pp. 174–184 — `{{ ref() }}` and `{{ source() }}` usage in staging models

- **Module 7** (Documentation): pp. 200–208 — descriptions, doc blocks, `dbt docs serve`

---

### Chapter 5 — dbt Advanced Topics
**Pages:** 223–250

**Key Insights:**
- **`view`** materialization: query stored on disk, data computed at runtime — for staging layers; slow to query on large datasets
- **`table`** materialization: `DROP + CREATE TABLE` on every run — fast to query, expensive to build; for marts with heavy downstream use
- **`ephemeral`** materialization: compiles to a CTE inside downstream models; no object created in DB; use sparingly (harder to debug)
- **`incremental`** materialization (pp. 227–228): processes only new/changed rows via `MERGE INTO`; requires `unique_key`; use `is_incremental()` macro + `{{ this }}` in WHERE clause
- **Materialized views / dynamic tables** (pp. 229–230): DB-managed incremental refresh; Snowflake uses `materialized: dynamic_table`
- **Snapshots / SCD2** (pp. 230–232): `dbt snapshot` command; `{% snapshot %}` block in `snapshots/` folder; adds `dbt_valid_from`, `dbt_valid_to`, `dbt_scd_id` columns; `strategy: timestamp` (recommended) or `check`
- **Jinja** (pp. 233–235): `{% %}` for statements (if/for/set), `{{ }}` for expressions, `{# #}` for comments; `target.name` to distinguish dev/prod behavior; `{%- -%}` trims whitespace
- **Macros** (pp. 236–241): Jinja functions in `macros/` folder; called with `{{ macro_name(args) }}`; use `run_query()` to execute SQL at compile time; support `return()`; can override dbt core macros (e.g., `generate_schema_name`)
- **dbt packages** (pp. 242–245): installed via `packages.yml` + `dbt deps`; `dbt_utils` (dbt Labs) provides `date_spine()`, `safe_divide()`, `generate_surrogate_key()`, and more
- **dbt semantic layer** (pp. 246–250): entities, dimensions, measures; MetricFlow framework; abstracts metric definitions from SQL

**Code Exercises:**

| Example | Pages | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 5-1, 5-2 | pp. 227–228 | Configure `stg_jaffle_shop_orders` as incremental with `merge` strategy + `unique_key`; add `is_incremental()` filter using `{{ this }}` |
| 5-3, 5-4 | pp. 229–230 | Configure materialized view (Postgres/BigQuery) and dynamic table (Snowflake) in YAML |
| 5-5 | pp. 231–232 | Create `snap_order_status_transition.sql` snapshot: `{% snapshot %}` block with `timestamp` strategy; run `dbt snapshot` |
| 5-6 | p. 233 | Jinja `{% if target.name != 'prod' %}` — limit data to last 3 months in dev |
| 5-7 | pp. 234–235 | Dynamic pivot using `{%- set payment_types = [...] -%}` + `{% for %}` loop to generate metric columns programmatically |
| 5-8 | p. 236 | Simplest macro: `{% macro sum(x, y) %}` |
| 5-13 to 5-17 | pp. 237–241 | `get_payment_types()` macro using `run_query()`; generalized `get_column_values(col, table)` macro; `limit_dataset_if_not_deploy_env()` macro called from `fct_orders` |
| 5-18 to 5-21 | pp. 243–245 | Install `dbt_utils` via `packages.yml` + `dbt deps`; use `date_spine()` macro; use `safe_divide()` in a model |

**Training Modules:**
- **Module 4** (Materializations): pp. 223–232 — full materialization coverage including incremental and snapshots
- **Module 3** (Jinja) deeper dive: pp. 233–235 — `{% if %}`, `{% for %}`, `{% set %}` in real dbt models
- **Module 9** (Jinja & Macros): pp. 236–245 — creating, calling, and parameterizing macros; installing packages
- **Module 10** (SCD2 & Snapshots): pp. 230–232 — `dbt snapshot`, SCD2 columns, strategy options

### Chapter 6 — Building an End-to-End Analytics Engineering Use Case
**Pages:** 253–296

**Key Insights:**
- A complete, real-world analytics engineering project from blank page to production: operational DB → ETL → analytics modeling → dbt implementation → tests + docs → SQL analytics
- **Operational modeling** follows conceptual → logical → physical exactly as Chapter 2 described; physical model uses MySQL DDL with audit columns (`CREATED_AT`, `UPDATED_AT`) required for incremental CDC
- **Star schema design for omnichannel retail:** 4 dimensions (`dim_channels`, `dim_customers`, `dim_products`, `dim_date`) + 2 fact tables (`fct_purchase_history`, `fct_visit_history`)
- **Naming conventions for enterprise dbt:** `stg_` (staging), `dim_` (dimension), `fct_` (fact); column prefixes `sk_` (surrogate key), `nk_` (natural/business key), `mtr_` (metric), `dsc_` (description/text), `dt_` (date/timestamp)
- **Surrogate keys** (`sk_`) are artificial identifiers assigned at the data warehouse layer; stable even if source natural keys change; generated with `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key()`
- **Conformed dimensions** (`dim_channels`, `dim_customers`, `dim_date`) are shared across multiple fact tables — update once, consistent everywhere
- **Singular tests for business rules** (pp. 283–285): `HAVING` clause returns failing rows — `mtr_total_amount_gross < 0`, `mtr_unit_price > mtr_total_amount_gross`
- **Analytics with star schema** (pp. 291–295): CTEs + window functions (`RANK() OVER PARTITION BY`) enable concise business queries like "top 3 products per channel" or "top customers on mobile app"

**Code Exercises:**

| Example | Pages | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 6-1 to 6-3 | pp. 257–259 | MySQL DDL: create `OMNI_MANAGEMENT` database; `CREATE TABLE` for `customers`, `products`, `channels`, `purchaseHistory`, `visitHistory` with FKs and audit columns |
| 6-4 to 6-8 | pp. 261–264 | Python ETL: `mysql.connector` → `pandas` → `pandas_gbq` to load all MySQL tables into BigQuery (extract, transform dates, load functions) |
| 6-9 to 6-10 | pp. 271–272 | dbt project folder structure; `_omnichannel_raw_sources.yml` to declare all 5 raw BigQuery tables as sources |
| 6-11 to 6-18 | pp. 272–278 | All staging models (`stg_channels`, `stg_customers`, `stg_products`, `stg_purchase_history`, `stg_visit_history`); all dimension models (`dim_channels`, `dim_customers`, `dim_products`, `dim_date` using `dbt_utils.date_spine`) |
| 6-19 to 6-23 | pp. 278–279 | Fact models `fct_purchase_history` and `fct_visit_history`: JOIN staging to dimension surrogate keys; `COALESCE(sk, '-1')` to handle unmatched FKs; compute derived metrics |
| 6-24 | pp. 281–282 | Full `_omnichannel_marts.yml`: generic tests — `unique`/`not_null` on all `sk_` PKs; `relationships` tests on all FK columns in both fact tables |
| 6-25 to 6-27 | pp. 283–285 | Singular tests: `assert_mtr_total_amount_gross_is_positive.sql`; `assert_mtr_unit_price_is_equal_or_lower_than_mtr_total_amount_gross.sql`; `assert_mtr_length_of_stay_is_positive.sql` |
| 6-28 | pp. 285–290 | Full YAML documentation: model descriptions + column descriptions for all dims and facts |
| 6-29 to 6-32 | pp. 291–295 | SQL analytics queries against the star schema: total sales per channel (simple GROUP BY), monthly revenue trend (date dim join), top 3 products per channel (CTEs + `RANK() OVER PARTITION BY`), top customers on mobile app (CTE + `LIMIT`) |

**Training Modules:**
- **Module 2** supplement: the dbt project setup walkthrough in pp. 271–272 is a second, more complex example of structuring a real project
- **Module 5** (Sources): Example 6-10 (pp. 271–272) is the reference for writing a `sources.yml` with multiple tables
- **Module 6** (Testing): pp. 280–285 — most complete test example in the book; covers both generic and singular tests on a full star schema
- **Module 7** (Documentation): Example 6-28 (pp. 285–290) — full documented YAML including model descriptions, column descriptions, and tests together
- **Module 10** (SCD2): the `dim_date` model using `dbt_utils.date_spine()` (pp. 276–278) demonstrates packages in practice
- **Capstone / Final Project**: Ch. 6 in its entirety is the blueprint for a Bloomwell end-to-end project — adapting the omnichannel schema to Bloomwell's HubSpot→deals→pipeline model makes an ideal capstone exercise
